Mood Journal with Music & Mindfulness

A Streamlit-based emotional wellness app that allows users to check in with their mood, receive personalized music recommendations, and generate calming AI affirmations — while also tracking mood history through visual analytics.

What It Does
This app helps users become more mindful of their emotional state by combining mood journaling with personalized AI support. It features:
- Mood check-in: User selects how they feel from predefined moods (e.g., Happy, Sad, Anxious, etc.)
- Mood-based song recommendations: Handpicked tracks to resonate with the user's emotional state
- AI-generated affirmations: Uses Hugging Face gpt2 model locally to generate supportive, mood-matching affirmations
- Mood logging: Every mood selection is timestamped and saved to a local JSON file
- Mood analytics: Displays interactive charts of historical mood trends using Altair
- Beautiful, animated UI: Soothing design using CSS and bubble animations

How It Relates to MoodScale
This prototype aligns with MoodScale’s vision of using emotion-driven insights to guide users toward self-awareness and better well-being. It demonstrates:
- A lightweight front-end experience
- Emotion capture, reflection, and recommendation
- AI integration in a wellness context
- Thoughtful UI/UX design suited for mental health products

How to Run It Locally
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/KartavyaChauhan/mood-journal-music-app.git
   cd mood-journal-music-app

2. Install the dependencies
   Make sure Python 3.8 or later is installed.
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:
   pip install streamlit pandas altair transformers

3. Run the app
   streamlit run app.py
   App will open at http://localhost:8501

Tools & Libraries Used
- Streamlit: Web UI framework
- Transformers (Hugging Face): Local GPT-2 for affirmation generation
- Altair: Charting library for mood history
- Pandas: Data transformation & logging
- JSON & datetime: Local mood log persistence
- Custom CSS: Styling & animations

Key Features
- Music Suggestions: Curated songs tied to each emotional state
- AI Affirmations: Personalized support generated with Hugging Face GPT-2
- Mood Chart: Tracks and visualizes frequency of moods over time
- Local Log: Saves mood entries to a JSON file for analysis
- Soothing UI: Animated background, gradients, and friendly interactions

Challenges Faced
- Spotify API Limitations: Originally planned to use Spotify audio features, but access token issues and rate limits made it unreliable in development mode.
- OpenAI API Quota: Initially used OpenAI GPT for affirmations, but hit quota limits. Switched to local Hugging Face GPT-2 for full offline support.
- Streamlit Session Management: Handling multiple button interactions and session state (st.session_state) required careful control to prevent UI conflicts.

Improvements With More Time
- Add mood intensity sliders or text journal input
- Embed real song previews via Spotify or YouTube
- Connect to Firebase or SQLite for user-specific persistent logs
- Add CSV export or cloud backup options for mood logs
- Use emotion classifiers for smarter suggestions or clustering
- Convert to mobile-first layout or PWA for better usability
